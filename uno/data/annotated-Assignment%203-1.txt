When a model is imported from Blender into Bambu Studio, it often appears considerably 
smaller than intended. This size discrepancy arises from the differing metric unit scales 
employed by each software application. The model must therefore be resized to i ts 
appropriate dimensions immediately after import to ensure accurate proportions. 
Performing this adjustment prior to any further modifications guarantees that subsequent 
edits, print configurations, and slicing operations preserve dimensional accuracy an d 
result in a successful 3D printing process.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I encountered this error repeatedly after reducing the size.  
 
 
Before scaling the model to its intended real -world dimensions, it is essential to first 
separate the hat from the elephant using Bambu Studio’s cutting tools. This preparatory 


step allows for greater precision and flexibility during the scaling process. By isolating the 
two components, each can be individually adjusted to ensure accurate proportions and 
optimal alignment. Moreover, separating the model enhances print efficiency,  as it enables 
tailored settings for each part —such as support placement, orientation, and print 
resolution. Utilizing the cut tools in this manner ensures a clean and controlled division, 
maintaining the structural integrity and visual fidelity of both th e hat and the elephant in 
their independent forms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


BLENDER SCALING   
 
 
In Blender 3D modeling software, the wrench icon located on the right -hand side of the 
interface represents the Modifiers  system, a core feature that enables non -destructive 
alterations to an object's geometry. Within this system, the Generate  category provides a 
range of tools designed to streamline model creation and modification.  
Among these tools, the Boolean modifier stands out for its precision and versatility. It 
operates based on Boolean logic, allowing one object to be used as a reference to cut, join, 
or intersect with another. In practical application, a designer may employ the Boolean 


modifier to subtract one mesh from another, creating cavities, engravings, or openings 
within a model.  
For instance, when applied to an elephant model with a smaller internal object serving as 
the operand, the Boolean modifier can perform a Difference  operation that removes 
intersecting geometry. This process produces a smooth internal cavity, effectively 
transforming a solid elephant model into a hollow structure, such as an “elephant kettle.” 
The Boolean modifier therefore serves as a powerful tool f or achieving complex geometric 
modifications efficiently while maintaining flexibility for further adjustments.  
 
 
 
 
After several adjustments and troubleshooting stages, the elephant and hat models were 
successfully positioned and prepared for the final 3D printing process.
